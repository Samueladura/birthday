Happy Birthday, Logos Jewel Temilola (a.k.a BossLady) ðŸ’–,

But before I start the wishing, I remembered vividely when we started talking at urp just like yesterday(smilesðŸ˜…). 

Well I actually thought you were gentle not until I knew you better that you're troublesome(there's nothing you can do for meðŸ˜œ).

How I became your elder brother I don't still know what or how it happened all I knew was you were calling me big bro.

She's one of the soul that disturd's me in UNIOSUN, any small thing she'll enter my DM drop stickers and she's always checking up if not regularlly sha

Something about this girl is that she does not eat, sleep all she wants to do is to read and since when I knew her she never completed a programming language not me always disturbing her to finish up with the one she started before moving to another oneðŸ˜….

Today, the world celebrates someone truly remarkable. Not just because itâ€™s your birthday, but because someone as rare, radiant, and deeply cherished as you walks this earth.

Youâ€™re not just specialâ€¦ youâ€™re a masterpiece. An hardworking girl, intelligence, beauty, and unwavering courage. Thank you for being a good friend like a sister a troublesome one.

As you celebrate another year of greatness, I pray your days are drenched in peace, joy, and victories that leave your heart full. May all the love you pour into others return to you a thousandfold.

Iâ€™m so honored to know you, so blessed to walk beside you, and so proud of everything you are and all that youâ€™re becoming.

Hereâ€™s to this new year of your life being the most magical yet full of answered prayers, wild laughter, sweet surprises, and the kind of love that makes your soul dance.

I cherish you beyond what words could ever express.

Try and finish up your Python and Javascript. 

With all my love,
Sammy ðŸŒ¹
