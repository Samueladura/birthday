Happy Birthday, Logos Jewel Temilola (a.k.a BossLady) ðŸ’–,

But before I start the wishing, I remembered vividly when we started talking at URP just like yesterday (smilesðŸ˜…). 

Well, I actually thought you were gentle until I knew you better youâ€™re troublesome (there's nothing you can do for meðŸ˜œ).

How I became your elder brother I still donâ€™t know all I knew was you started calling me big bro.

She's one of the souls that disturb me in UNIOSUN. Any small thing, sheâ€™ll enter my DM, drop stickers, and check up on me maybe not regularly sha.

Something about this girl is that she does not eat or sleep all she wants to do is read. And since I knew her, she has never completed a programming language ðŸ˜‚. Not me always disturbing her to finish up one before starting another ðŸ˜….

Today, the world celebrates someone truly remarkable. Not just because itâ€™s your birthday, but because someone as rare, radiant, and deeply cherished as you walks this earth.

Youâ€™re not just specialâ€¦ youâ€™re a masterpiece hardworking, intelligent, beautiful, and filled with unwavering courage. Thank you for being a good friend, like a sister (a troublesome one though ðŸ˜„).

As you celebrate another year of greatness, I pray your days are drenched in peace, joy, and victories that leave your heart full. May all the love you pour into others return to you a thousandfold.

Iâ€™m so honored to know you, so blessed to walk beside you, and so proud of everything you are and all that youâ€™re becoming.

Hereâ€™s to this new year of your life being the most magical yet full of answered prayers, wild laughter, sweet surprises, and the kind of love that makes your soul dance.

I cherish you beyond what words could ever express.

Try and finish up your Python and JavaScript. ðŸ˜‚

With all my love,  
Sammy ðŸŒ¹
